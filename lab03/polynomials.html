    <p>If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:</p>
    <p>Constant</p>
        <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a.</dd>
    <p>Linear</p>
        <dd>Linear polynomials have the form a &times; x + b. </dd>
    <p>Quadratic</p>
        <dd>Quadratic polynomials have the form a &times; x&sup2; + b &times; x + c. </dd>
    <p>Cubic</p>
        <dd>Cubic polynomials have the form a &times; x&sup3; + b &times; x&sup2; + c &times; x + d.</dd>
