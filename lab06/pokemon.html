    <p>
    Jigglypuff is a playable character, but it must be unlocked by clearing the 1-Player mode with any character. Jigglypuff has one of the best recoveries in the game and can use its low-power aerial attacks to combo larger and heavier opponents easily, but it also the lightest character and thus very easy to knock off the stage. Jigglypuff shares the Saffron City stage with Pikachu.

    <div class="name"> Pikachu</div>
    <p>
 Pikachu is a playable character, and the only Pokémon that is playable from the start of the game. Its main stage is Saffron City.
In the hands of a skilled player, Pikachu is not to be taken lightly. Alongside electrical attacks, it has very good aerial attacks and superb, but hard to master, recovery move. Pikachu is also one of the lightest characters in the game, making it easy for its foes to launch it. Despite this, top-level SSB players have placed Pikachu at the top of their list, theoretically making it the best character in the game.
